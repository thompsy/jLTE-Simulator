# jLTE Simulator

## Overview 

The jLTE Simulator is a network simulator designed to simulate the
physical layer of an LTE network consisting of a number of base
stations (eNodeBs) and users (UEs). It was designed specifically for
the research project investigating the effect of co-ordinated
scheduling in LTE networks. Further documentation is included within
the thesis itself which is availabe at [downthewire.co.uk][1].

## Getting Started 
This project was built using Apache Maven which can be downloaded from 
[maven.apache.org][2] and installed by following the instructions on that 
page.

Before the system can be fully compiled Michael Thomas Flanagan's Java 
Scientific Library must be installed. The jar file must be downloaded 
and installed into your local maven repository. This can be achieved using
the following commands:

`wget http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/flanagan.jar`

`mvn install:install-file -Dfile=flanagan.jar -DgroupId=flanagan -DartifactId=flanagan -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar`

The project can then be compiled in the same fashion as any maven
project using the following command:

`mvn compile`


### Generating Fading Data 

In order to use the simulator run the tests some auxiliary fading data
must be generated. This data is used to model the signal quality of
the wireless channel between each user and base station. The location
of the fading data is specified in the `lte.fadingPath` configuration
option in the `system.properties` config file which can be found in
the `src/main/resources/` directory.

The fading data can be generated by running the `GenerateFading` main
class in the package `uk.co.downthewire.jLTE.fading`. This can be 
executed in maven using the command 'mvn exec:java'. Note that significant 
heap space can be required to generate adequate fading data.

### Running Tests

Having generated the fading data required the tests can now be run
using the standard maven command:

`mvn test`

The test suite includes both unit and integration tests which will
take ~10 minutes to complete.

### Running the Simulator

Now that the tests are all passing you can begin to run your own
network scenarios. Some example scenarios are defined as part of the
test suite, see the `src/test/resources/` directory. Each scenario
contains a config file for the UEs and a config file for the eNodeBs.
A number of settings are also defined in the `system.properties`
configuration file.
